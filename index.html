      <p>  My name is Kayla, and I am a junior at Cornell University, where I double major in Information Science and Communication. Throughout my budding career, I’ve fostered a passion for technology, design, and writing, and I have enjoyed seeing these interests develop in college. With a diverse set of interests, I’m looking forward to the opportunity to grow professionally and personally in a post-grad position. </p>

      <p> While at Cornell, I’ve immersed myself in my community both on and off campus. I’m the City Editor at The Cornell Daily Sun and a member of Cameradery, a student-led club that teaches photography to children with cognitive disabilities. I furthermore am the VP of Marketing for Cornell’s chapter of The Women’s Network (TWN) and a National Blog Editorial Intern for TWN, for which I curate TWN’s National Blog. Moreover, I'm an active member of the SWEEP Project Team for Cornell Sustainability Consultants, where I create waste management calculators and advise local industries and governments on sustainable waste practices, specifically helping them achieve SWEEP Standard Certification. </p>

      <p>When I’m not participating in extracurriculars or am in the classroom, you can probably find me watching my favorite sports teams –– the San Francisco Giants, the Golden State Warriors, and the Dallas Cowboys –– spending time with my friends and family, or listening to music! </p>
