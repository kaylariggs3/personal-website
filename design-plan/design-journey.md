# Project 3: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **please do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Existing Project (Milestone 1)

**Tell us about the project you'll be using for Project 3.**

### Project (Milestone 1)
> Which project will you add interactivity to enhance the site's functionality?

Project 1.


### Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group.

My website’s intended audience consists of job recruiters/future employers who are looking to hire someone with a marketing/design/writing background for a UX/UI Design role. I wanted to design my website for recruiters that specifically fit my career interests; thus, I cultivated my site for UX/UI Design hiring mangers, which is the field I’m hoping to enter. Because UX/UI Design is centered around user experience, I thought my site’s intended audience was especially appropriate seeing as this page will hopefully benefit their hiring experience.

This is a cohesive group because everyone in the audience likely has the same objective: hire someone for a UX/UI role. Moreover, job recruiters are all likely familiar with navigating personal websites, meaning that they're able to approach my site with similar experience levels and general understanding.


### Audience's Goals (Milestone 1)
> List the audience's goals that you identified in Project 1 or 2.
> Simply list each goal. No need to include the "Design Ideas and Choices", etc.
> You may adjust the goals if necessary.

1. Learn about my professional and academic experience

2. Gain a better understanding of who I am as a person beyond a traditional CV or resume

3. Identify my career goals moving forward


## Interactivity Design (Milestone 1)

### Interactivity Brainstorm (Milestone 1)
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience.
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- Idea #1: Design images can be clicked;  info about the project displayed when clicked
  - RATIONALE: By displaying further information about each design I've created, hiring managers looking at my site will be able to better understand my professional experience, which meets one of their objectives. This can help them identify whether or not I'm qualified for a UX/UI position.
- Idea #2: Accordion menus for "resume" page
  - RATIONALE: Including accordion menus for the resume page once again helps potential hiring managers understand my prior professional and academic experience more fully. Including an image of my resume can make it more difficult for a hiring manager to see certain elements within my resume (e.x. small font sizes or blurriness can make some information hard to read); hence, these accordion menus help accomplish the goals of my audience while also enhancing usability and readability.
- Idea #3: Accordion menus for "marketing" and "writing" experience
  - RATIONALE: Implementing accordion menus for "marketing" and "writing" experience accomplishes a similar feat to the one described above. By doing so, the information on the "Work" page is better organized, allowing my audience to more easily access my previous work. This could help them determine whether I'm qualified for a related position.
- Idea #4: Gallery of images on "About" page
  - RATIONALE: Creating a gallery of images meets the second goal I've stipulated previously: gain a better understanding of who I am as a person beyond a traditional CV or resume. Including more images of myself and my interests can not only help a recruiter put a face to the name, but can also enable them to understand my personality and interests more than a traditional paper resume could.
- Idea #5: Drop-down menu for some elements in nav bar (e.x. For work & resume pages)
  - RATIONALE: Including a drop-down menu, like ideas 2 and 3, better organizes my content, making it easier for the audience to achieve their goals (specifically, the goal of learning about my prior experience, since this drop-down menu applies to the "Work" and "Resume" pages). By making my site more accessible and usable with a navigation bar drop-down menu, my audience will be able to find the information that they're looking for more easily and rapidly, making their overall experience on my site much better.

### Interactivity Design Ideation (Milestone 1)
> Explore the possible design solutions for the interactivity.
> Sketch several iterations of your interactivity.
> Annotate each sketch explaining what happens when a user takes an action. (e.g. When user clicks this, something else appears.)

IDEA #5:

UPDATE: After seeing an Ed Discussion post by Prof. Harms, using dropdown menus was highly discouraged due to the time constraints of this project. Thus, I have decided to add page anchors to the nav bar, meaning that this component will not qualify for interactivity. However, I still wanted to leave the sketch in as this was an idea I would've implemented if I had the time.

### Final Interactivity Design (Milestone 1)
> Create _polished_ sketch(es) (it's still a sketch, but with a little more care taken to communicate ideas clearly to the graders) to plan your interactivity.
> **Sketch out the entire page where your interactivity will go.**
> Include your interactivity to the sketch(es).
> Add annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action.
> Include as many sketches as necessary to communicate your design (ask yourself, could another 1300 take these sketches an implement my design?)

_As explained above, the nav bar will have page anchors, but, since this doesn't qualify as interactivity, I haven't included it in the final sketches_

**UPDATE: 11/8/22: After talking to Prof. Harms, I was advised to only implement the accordion menu. Hence, the new sketches from here onward are solely for that implementation.**

### Interactivity Rationale (Milestone 1)
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience.
> This should be about a paragraph. (3-5 sentences)

The interactivity shown above achieves my audience's goals of learning more about my professional and academic experience as well as gauging my future career goals; it better organizes the content across my website, enabling my audience to more easily access exactly what they are looking for. Specifically, the accordion menus and information displayed on my design images achieve this. Moreover, the audience's goal of becoming more familiar with me beyond a traditional resume or CV is accomplished, particularly through the gallery of images that can better represent my personality to users. Ultimately, each interactive element allows for enhanced usability and readability, making it easier for my audience to meet their objectives when visiting my site.

UPDATE: ACCORDION MENU IMPLEMENTATION:
The accordion menu's interactivity certainly achieves my audience's goals. By adding an accordion menu, my audience is able to better understand and explore my academic/professional experience, and gauge my professional interests more clearly. Removing the image of my resume allows for increased usability and readability; photos can be blurry, and the text on my resume was small in the picture, making it difficult for my audience to see. Thus, the accordion makes the site simpler and easier to navigate, allowing my audience to achieve their objectives more effectively and efficiently.

### "Ambitious" Interactivity Explanation (Milestone 1)
> In your own words, concisely explain why you believe your interactivity meets the "ambitious" requirement.
> This should be a few sentences. (1-3 sentences)

My design warrants ambitious interactivity because it introduces four unique ideas that are resonably complex and allows me to use all 3 browser layers together. Moreover, it goes beyond "basic" examples explored in class (like the information displayed on my design images), further proving that my plan is zealous. Finally, although I had to take out the drop-down interactivity for my nav bar per Prof. Harms's advice, I will be implenting page anchors, which adds to my site and makes my overall design more ambitious.

UPDATE 11/8/22:
After attending office hours and receiving input from Prof. Harms, I was advised to only implement one idea due to time constraints of the project: the accordion menu. This interactivity is still ambitious, however, because it goes beyond what was learned in class, allowing me to practice using 3 browser layers (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS)concurrently. Moreover, the accordion menu required me to add more textual information in my HTML file for the "Resume" page, making the idea more zealous.

## Grading (Final Submission)

### Interactivity Usability Justification (Final Submission)
> Explain how your design effectively uses affordances, visibility, feedback, and familiarity.
> Write a large paragraph (4-6 sentences)

In terms of affordances, which provide stark clues for the way that a certain element operates, the ability to hover over the buttons on my menu as well as the cursor's simultaneous change to a pointer (when a user hovers over the button) strongly indicates that the buttons on the menu can be clicked. Moreover, visibility is apparent in my accordion menu as it takes up the entirety of the page; additionally, the text content is visible after a user clicks the button, and the border box enhances this aparentness. Feedback, defined in lecture as giving an action an immediate and clear effect, can be seen in the '+' sign located to the right of the button names as it changes to a '-' sign when it's clicked (and vice versa: the '-' changes back to a '+' when it's clicked again). This allows the user to know that the interactive element is working. Moreover, the appearance of text also provides useful feedback to the user that the interactivity (or that their click on the button) is functioning properly. Finally, familiarity is evident in the way in which my accordion menu operates; like other implementations of accordion menus, a user can click on a button (that has a specific title) to reveal more information. Moreover, the accordion menu also contains a '+' sign to indicate that it is closed and a '-' sign to indicate that it's open, another common design of this interactive element.

### Tell Us What to Grade (Final Submission)
> We aren't re-grading your Project 1 or 2.
> We are only grading the interactivity you added.
> Tell us where (what pages) we can find your interactivity and how to use it.
> **We will only grade what you list here;** if it's not listed, we won't grade it.

On the "Resume" page (resume.html), there is an accordion menu; this is the only page (and its respective interactivity) that requires grading for my initial Project 1.


### Collaborators (Final Submission)
> List any persons you collaborated with on this project.

I went to office hours on 11/7 and received help from Kyle Harms. I also received help from a TA during the 8 p.m. office hours on 11/7.Otherwise, N/A.

### Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> This was the first project in this class where you coded some JavaScript. What did you learn from this experience?

From this experience, I learned that coding in a new language (i.e. JavaScript) requires attentiveness and resilience. It can be frustrating when the code doesn't work as planned the first time it's implemented; however, by continuing to try different implementations and by editing my code to eventually make the program work as I want it to, I found coding in JavaScript to be really rewarding (after all, it produces some amazing interactivity and provides useful skills for industry!). Going forward, I want to continue to learn new programming languages that can better enhance my web design skills!

> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!

It's been extremely rewarding to see the tangible progress I've been able to make since the start of the year. One of the main reasons why I originally took this class was because I wanted to leave Cornell with hard skills that could be applied to a future career, preferably in UX/UI Design. Being able to know basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS certainly achieves this objective, and I'm very happy that I can use these skills in future classes and outside opportunities. I'm ultimately excited to see the culmination of all of everything we've learned in the final project of the semester, and to continue learning new web design concepts!
